After installing necessary packages you can run the code in Test Suite by following link https://github.com/ademilua/API_TASK/blob/master/API_Task/API_Task/Test_Suite.cs

Test Suites has 7 Test Cases which covers Positive and Negative cases related to The API based on specification document.
Test Cases are following:
1. First test case verifies positive case of getting HTTP 200 and isValid attribute having True Value. 
It's tested by sending valid Token and Valid IBAN code to correct API.
2. Second test case verifies IBAN checking by sending valid Token with invalid IBAN. In that case, HTTP 200 is returned but isValid attribute will have False value.
3. Third test case verifies negative case of getting Unathorized HTTP error with 401 HTTP code and with message attribute returned having "Authorization has been denied for this request." value. 
It's tested by sending request with missing Token and correct IBAN.
4. Fourth test case is also verifying negative case of getting Unathorized HTTP error with 401 HTTP code and with message attribute returned having "Authorization has been denied for this request." value.
However, in this test case the request is initiated with invalid Token instead of missing one. IBAN values is still correct. 
5. Fifth test case verifies negative case of getting Bad Request HTTP error with 400 HTTP code and with type attribute returned having "BusinessError" value. It is tested by sending incorrect IBAN, that has shorter length and correct Token. 
6. Sixth test case also verifies negative case of getting Bad Request HTTP error with 400 HTTP code and with type attribute returned having "BusinessError" value. 
However, in this test case the IBAN is missing and Token is correct. 
7. The last, seventh test case verifies that bank account with format different from IBAN is not accepted as legit format. In this test case, credit card is generated by using online tool in following link formathttps://www.bincodes.com/bank-creditcard-generator/
It also verifies negative case of getting Bad Request HTTP error with 400 HTTP code and with type attribute returned having "BusinessError" value. 



NOTES:


200 HTTP isvalid True
Positive 200 HTTP isvalid False
Negative token is missing 401 HTTP 
Negative token is incorrect 401 HTTP 
Negative iban length is incorrect 400 HTTP 
Negative iban length is empty 400 HTTP 
Negative Incorrect IBAN country 400 HTTP
